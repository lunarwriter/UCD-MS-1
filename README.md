* ## Design

    * __Colour Scheme__

        * The main colours used are dark navy blue, slate gray, and white.

    * __Typography__

        * The two main fonts used for the website are Anton and Lato. Anton has a distinctively energetic character and stands out, which is fitting for a website about a gym. The Lato font is very clean and widely used among programmers, so it is very fitting as well as attractive.

    * __Imagery__

        * The imagery is essential. The large hero image on the homepage is designed to appear both eye-catching, motivating and purposeful.
