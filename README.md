* ### Design

    * __Colour Scheme__

        * The main colours used are dark navy blue, slate gray, and white.

    * __Typography__

        * The two main fonts used for the website are Anton and Lato. Anton has a distinctively energetic character and stands out, which is fitting for a website about a gym. The Lato font is very clean and widely used among programmers, so it is very fitting as well as attractive.

    * __Imagery__

        * The imagery is essential. The large hero image on the homepage is designed to appear both eye-catching, motivating and purposeful.

 __Possible Future Features__

* The website could be improved by adding a feature for a webshop for Dolly's Dojo products. 
By adding this feature, users can get appropriate and safe fitness gear to attend the gym, the group classes or gym at home if they wish.

* Another feature that could improve the website is adding online group classes.
By adding this feature, users can attend the gym from their own home and stay as fit as ever. The users could attend a virtual class with instructors giving live classes.
